Idaª kho pana bhikkhave dukkhaª ariya-saccaª:
Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress:

J›tipi dukkh› jar›pi dukkh› mara˚ampi dukkhaª,
Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful.

Soka-parideva-dukkha-domanass’up›y›s›pi dukkh›,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful,

Appiyehi sampayogo dukkho piyehi vippayogo
dukkho yam-p’icchaª na labhati tampi dukkhaª.
association with what is unbeloved is stressful, separation from what is
beloved is stressful, not getting what one wants is stressful.

Saºkhittena pañcup›d›nakkhandh› dukkh›.
In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.

Idaª kho pana bhikkhave dukkha-samudayo ariyasaccaª:

And this, monks, is the noble truth of the origination of stress:

Seyyathıdaª,
K›ma-ta˚h› bhava-ta˚h› vibhava-ta˚h›.
the craving that makes for further becoming—accompanied by passion &
delight, relishing now here & now there—i.e., craving for sensuality,
craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.

Idaª kho pana bhikkhave dukkha-nirodho ariyasaccaª:
And this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of stress:

Yo tass› yeva ta˚h›ya asesa-vir›ga-nirodho c›go

the remainderless fading & cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release,
& letting go of that very craving.

Idaª kho pana bhikkhave dukkha-nirodha-g›minıpa˛ipad› ariya-saccaª:
And this, monks, is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the

And, monks, as long as this—my three-round, twelve-permutation knowledge

pure, I did not claim to have directly awakened to the right self-awakening
unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas, M›ras, & Brahm›s, with its
contemplatives & br›hmans, its royalty & common people.

But as soon this—my three-round, twelve-permutation knowledge & vision

then I did claim to have directly awakened to the right self-awakening

Idam-avoca Bhagav›.

Attaman› pañca-vaggiy› bhikkhÒ Bhagavato

That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the group of five monks
delighted at his words.

Imasmiñ-ca pana veyy›-kara˚asmiª bhaññam›ne,
ﬁyasmato Ko˚˜aññassa virajaª vıtamalaª dhammacakkhuª udap›di,
And while this explanation was being given, there arose to Ven. Ko˚˜añña
the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye:

“Yaº-kiñci samudaya-dhammaª sabban-taª
nirodha-dhammanti.”
“Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.”

Pavattite ca Bhagavat› dhamma-cakke,
Bhumm› dev› saddamanuss›vesuª,
Now when the Blessed One had set the Wheel of Dhamma in motion, the
earth devas cried out:

“Etam-Bhagavat› B›r›˚asiyaª isipatane migad›ye
anuttaraª dhamma-cakkaª pavattitaª,
Appa˛ivattiyaª sama˚ena v› br›hma˚ena v› devena

“At V›r›˚asi, in the Game Refuge at Isipatana, the Blessed One has set in
motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by br›hman
or contemplative, deva, M›ra, Brahm›, or anyone at all in the cosmos.”

Bhumm›naª dev›naª saddaª sutv›,
C›tummah›r›jik› dev› saddamanuss›vesuª.
On hearing the earth devas’ cry, the devas of the Heaven of the Four Kings
took up the cry.

C›tummah›r›jik›naª dev›naª saddaª sutv›,
T›vatiªs› dev› saddamanuss›vesuª.
On hearing the cry of the devas of the Heaven of the Four Kings, the devas
of the Heaven of the Thirty-three took up the cry.

T›vatiªs›naª dev›naª saddaª sutv›,
Y›m› dev› saddamanuss›vesuª.
On hearing the cry of the devas of the Heaven of the Thirty-three, the Yama
devas took up the cry.

Y›m›naª dev›naª saddaª sutv›,
Tusit› dev› saddamanuss›vesuª.
On hearing the cry of the Yama devas, the Tusita devas took up the cry.

Tusit›naª dev›naª saddaª sutv›,
Nimm›naratı dev› saddamanuss›vesuª.
On hearing the cry of the Tusita devas, the Nimmanarati devas took up
the cry.

Nimm›naratınaª dev›naª saddaª sutv›,
Paranimmita-vasavattı dev› saddamanuss›vesuª.
On hearing the cry of the Nimmanarati devas, the Paranimmita-vasavatti
devas took up the cry.

Paranimmita-vasavattınaª dev›naª saddaª sutv›,
Brahma-k›yik› dev› saddamanuss›vesuª,
On hearing the cry of the Paranimmita-vasavatti devas, the devas of
Brahm›’s retinue took up the cry:

“Etam-Bhagavat› B›r›˚asiyaª isipatane migad›ye
anuttaraª dhamma-cakkaª pavattitaª,
Appa˛ivattiyaª sama˚ena v› br›hma˚ena v› devena

“At V›r›˚asi, in the Game Refuge at Isipatana, the Blessed One has set in
motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by br›hman
or contemplative, deva, M›ra, Brahm›, or anyone at all in the cosmos.”

Itiha tena kha˚ena tena muhuttena,
Y›va brahma-lok› saddo abbhuggacchi.
So in that moment, that instant, the cry shot right up to the Brahm› world.

Ayañ-ca dasa-sahassı loka-dh›tu,

And this ten-thousandfold cosmos shivered & quivered & quaked,

Appam›˚o ca o˘›ro obh›so loke p›turahosi,
Atikkammeva dev›naª dev›nubh›vaª.
while a great, measureless radiance appeared in the cosmos, surpassing the
effulgence of the devas.

Atha kho Bhagav› ud›naª ud›nesi,
“Aññ›si vata bho Ko˚˜añño,
Aññ›si vata bho Ko˚˜aññoti.”
Then the Blessed One exclaimed: “So you really know, Ko˚˜añña? So you
really know?”

Itihidaª ›yasmato Ko˚˜aññassa,
Añña-ko˚˜añño’tveva n›maª,
ahosıti.
And that is how Ven. Ko˚˜añña acquired the name Añña-Ko˚˜añña—
Kondañña who knows.

Anatta-lakkha˚a Sutta
The Discourse on the Not-self Characteristic

[Evam-me sutaª,] Ekaª samayaª Bhagav›,
B›r›˚asiyaª viharati isipatane migad›ye.
Tatra kho Bhagav› pañca-vaggiye bhikkhÒ ›mantesi.
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at V›r›˚asi
in the Game Refuge at Isipatana. There he addressed the group of five
monks:

“RÒpaª bhikkhave anatt›.
RÒpañ-ca hidaª bhikkhave att› abhavissa,
Nayidaª rÒpaª ›b›dh›ya saªvatteyya,
Labbhetha ca rÒpe,

‘Evaª me rÒpaª hotu evaª me rÒpaª m› ahosıti.’
“Form, monks, is not-self. If form were self, this form would not
lend itself to dis-ease, and it would be possible (to say) with regard to form,
‘Let my form be thus. Let my form not be thus.’

Yasm› ca kho bhikkhave rÒpaª anatt›,
Tasm› rÒpaª ›b›dh›ya saªvattati,
Na ca labbhati rÒpe,
‘Evaª me rÒpaª hotu evaª me rÒpaª m› ahosıti.’
But precisely because form is not-self, form lends itself to dis-ease,
and it is not possible (to say) with regard to form, ‘Let my form be thus.
Let my form not be thus.’

Vedan› anatt›.
Vedan› ca hidaª bhikkhave att› abhavissa,
Nayidaª vedan› ›b›dh›ya saªvatteyya.
Labbhetha ca vedan›ya,
‘Evaª me vedan› hotu evaª me vedan› m› ahosıti.’
Feeling is not-self. If feeling were self, this feeling would not lend itself
to dis-ease, and it would be possible (to say) with regard to feeling, ‘Let my
feeling be thus. Let my feeling not be thus.’

Yasm› ca kho bhikkhave vedan› anatt›,

‘Evaª me vedan› hotu evaª me vedan› m› ahosıti.’
But precisely because feeling is not-self, feeling lends itself to dis-ease. And
it is not possible (to say) with regard to feeling, ‘Let my feeling be thus. Let
my feeling not be thus.’

Saññ› anatt›.
Saññ› ca hidaª bhikkhave att› abhavissa,
Nayidaª saññ› ›b›dh›ya saªvatteyya,
Labbhetha ca saññ›ya,
‘Evaª me saññ› hotu evaª me saññ› m› ahosıti.’

Perception is not-self. If perception were self, this perception would not
lend itself to dis-ease, and it would be possible (to say) with regard to
perception, ‘Let my perception be thus. Let my perception not be thus.’

Yasm› ca kho bhikkhave saññ› anatt›,
Tasm› saññ› ›b›dh›ya saªvattati,
Na ca labbhati saññ›ya,
‘Evaª me saññ› hotu evaª me saññ› m› ahosıti.’
But precisely because perception is not-self, perception lends itself to disease. And it is not possible (to say) with regard to perception, ‘Let my
perception be thus. Let my perception not be thus.’

Saºkh›r› anatt›.
Saºkh›r› ca hidaª bhikkhave att› abhavissaªsu,

Labbhetha ca saºkh›resu, Evaª me saºkh›r› hontu

Fabrications are not-self. If fabrications were self, these fabrications would
not lend themselves to dis-ease, and it would be possible (to say) with regard
to fabrication, ‘Let my fabrications be thus. Let my fabrications not be thus.’

Yasm› ca kho bhikkhave saºkh›r› anatt›,
Tasm› saºkh›r› ›b›dh›ya saªvattanti,
Na ca labbhati saºkh›resu,
‘Evaª me saºkh›r› hontu evaª me saºkh›r› m›

But precisely because fabrications are not-self, fabrications lend
themselves to dis-ease, and it is not possible (to say) with regard to
fabrications, ‘Let my fabrications be thus. Let my fabrications not be thus.’

Viññ›˚aª anatt›.
Viññ›˚añ-ca hidaª bhikkhave att› abhavissa,

Labbhetha ca viññ›˚e,

‘Evaª me viññ›˚aª hotu evaª me viññ›˚aª m›

Consciousness is not-self. If consciousness were self, this consciousness
would not lend itself to dis-ease, and it would be possible (to say) with
regard to consciousness, ‘Let my consciousness be thus. Let my
consciousness not be thus.’

Yasm› ca kho bhikkhave viññ›˚aª anatt›,

But precisely because consciousness is not-self, consciousness lends itself to

my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.’

Mah›-samaya Sutta
The Great Meeting

[Evam-me sutaª.] Ekaª samayaª Bhagav›,
Sakkesu viharati Kapilavatthusmiª Mah›vane,
mahat› bhikkhu-saºghena saddhiª pañca-mattehi
bhikkhu-satehi sabbeh’eva arahantehi. Dasahi ca
loka-dh›tÒhi devat› yebhuyyena sannipatit› honti
Bhagavantaª dassan›ya bhikkhu-saºghañ-ca.
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among
the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood, together with a large
Saºgha of approximately five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants. And
most of the devat›s from ten world-systems had gathered in order to see the
Blessed One & the Bhikkhu Saºgha.

Atha kho catunnaª suddh›v›sa-k›yik›naª
dev›naª etad-ahosi, “Ayaª kho Bhagav› Sakkesu
viharati Kapilavatthusmiª Mah›vane,

Dasahi ca loka-dh›tÒhi devat› yebhuyyena

YannÒna mayam-pi yena Bhagav›
ten’upasaºkameyy›ma, upasaºkamitv› Bhagavato
santike pacceka-g›th› bh›seyy›m›ti.”
Then the thought occurred to four devat›s of the ranks from the Pure
Abodes: “The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu
in the Great Wood, together with a large Saºgha of about five hundred
bhikkhus, all of them arahants. And most of the devat›s from ten world-

systems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One & the Bhikkhu
Saºgha. Let us also approach the Blessed One and, on arrival, let us each
speak a verse in his presence.”

Atha kho t› devat› seyyath›-pi n›ma balav› puriso

devat› Bhagavato santike imaª g›thaª abh›si.
Then, just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his
extended arm, those devat›s disappeared from among the devas of the Pure
Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed One. Having paid homage to the
Blessed One, they stood to one side. As they were standing there, one devat›
recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:

“Mah›-samayo pavanasmiª Deva-k›y› sam›gat›
ﬁgatamha imaª dhamma-samayaª
Dakkhit›yeva apar›jita-saºghanti.
“A great meeting in the woods:
The deva hosts have assembled.
We have come to this Dhamma meeting
to see the unvanquished Saºgha.”

Atha kho apar› devat› Bhagavato santike imaª

“Tatra bhikkhavo sam›dahaªsu
Cittaª attano ujukam-akaªsu
S›rathı va nett›ni gahetv›
Indriy›ni rakkhanti pa˚˜it›ti.”

Then another devat› recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:
“There the bhikkhus are concentrated,
have straightened their own minds.
Like a charioteer holding the reins,
the wise ones guard their faculties.”

Atha kho apar› devat› Bhagavato santike imaª
g›thaª abh›si.
“Chetv› khılaª chetv› palıghaª
Inda-khılam-ohaccam-anej›,
Te caranti suddh› vimal›
Cakkhumat› sudant› susu-n›g›ti.”
Then another devat› recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:
“Having cut through barrenness, cut the cross-bar,
having uprooted Indra’s pillar, unstirred,
they wander about pure, unstained,
young n›gas well-tamed by the One with Vision.”

Atha kho apar› devat› Bhagavato santike imaª
g›thaª abh›si.
“Ye keci Buddhaª sara˚aª gat›se
Na te gamissanti ap›ya-bhÒmiª.
Pah›ya m›nusaª dehaª
Deva-k›yaª paripÒressantıti.”
Then another devat› recited this verse in the Blessed One’s presence:
“Those who have gone to the Buddha for refuge
will not go to the plane of woe.
On discarding the human body,
they will fill the hosts of the devas.”

Atha kho Bhagav› bhikkhÒ ›mantesi,
“Yebhuyyena bhikkhave dasasu loka-dh›tÒsu devat›

Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, most of the devat›s
from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Tath›gata & the
Bhikkhu Saºgha. Those who, in the past, were Pure Ones, Rightly Selfawakened, at most had their devat›-gathering like mine at the present. Those
who, in the future, will be Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, will at most
have their devat›-gathering like mine at the present.

“Evam-bhanteti” kho te bhikkhÒ Bhagavato

Bhagav› etad-avoca.
“I will tell you the names of the deva hosts. I will describe to you
the names of the deva hosts. I will teach you the names of the deva hosts.
Listen & pay close attention. I will speak.”
“As you say, lord,” the monks replied. The Blessed One said:

“I recite a verse of tribute.
Those who live where spirits dwell,
who live in mountain caves, resolute, concentrated,
many, like hidden lions, who have overcome horripilation,
white-hearted, pure, serene, & undisturbed:

Knowing that more than 500 of them
had come to the forest of Kapilavastu,
the Teacher then said to them, disciples delighting in his instruction,
‘The deva hosts have approached. Detect them, monks!’
Listening to the Awakened One’s instruction,
they made an ardent effort.
Knowledge appeared to them, vision of non-human beings.
Some saw 100, some 1,000, some 70,000,
some had vision of 100,000 non-human beings.
Some gained vision of innumerable devas filling every direction.

Realizing all this, the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.
The Teacher then said to them,

‘The deva hosts have approached. Detect them, monks,
as I describe their glories, one by one.

Now look at the Dark One’s foolishness!
[He said:] ‘Come seize them! Bind them!
Tie them down with passion!
Surround them on every side!
Don’t let anyone at all escape!’
Thus the great warlord urged on his dark army,
slapping the ground with his hand,

making a horrendous din,
as when a storm cloud bursts with thunder,
lightning, & torrents of rain.
But then he withdrew—enraged,
with none under his sway.

Realizing all this,
the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.
The Teacher then said to them,
disciples delighting in his instruction,
‘M›ra’s army has approached. Detect them, monks!’
Listening to the Awakened One’s instruction,
they made an ardent effort.
The army retreated from those without passion,
without raising even a hair on their bodies.
Having all won the battle—prestigious, past fear—
they rejoice with all beings:
disciples outstanding among the human race.”

[Evam-me sutaª,] Ekaª samayaª Bhagav›,

saªvattanti. Katame cha?
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near
S›vatthı in Jeta’s Grove, An›thapi˚˜ika’s park. There he addressed the
monks, “Monks!” “Yes, lord,” the monks responded to him. The Blessed One
said: “Monks, these six conditions are conducive to amiability, engender feelings of endearment, engender feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, & a state of unity. Which six?

“Idha bhikkhave bhikkhuno, mettaª k›ya-kammaª

ca. Ayam-pi dhammo s›r›˚ıyo piya-kara˚o garukara˚o, saºgah›ya aviv›d›ya s›maggiy› ekı-bh›v›ya
saªvattati.

[1] “There is the case where a monk is set on bodily acts of goodwill with
regard to his fellows in the holy life, to their faces & behind their backs.
This is a condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings
of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship,
a lack of disputes, harmony, & a state of unity.

“Puna c’aparaª bhikkhave bhikkhuno, mettaª vacıkammaª paccupa˛˛hitaª hoti, sabrahmac›rısu ›vi

garu-kara˚o, saºgah›ya aviv›d›ya s›maggiy› ekıbh›v›ya saªvattati.
[2] “Furthermore, the monk is set on verbal acts of goodwill with regard
to his fellows in the holy life, to their faces & behind their backs. This is a
condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack
of disputes, harmony, & a state of unity.

“Puna c’aparaª bhikkhave bhikkhuno, mettaª
mano-kammaª paccupa˛˛hitaª hoti, sabrahmac›rısu
›vi c’eva raho ca. Ayam-pi dhammo s›r›˚ıyo piyakara˚o garu-kara˚o, saºgah›ya aviv›d›ya s›maggiy›
ekı-bh›v›ya saªvattati.
[3] “Furthermore, the monk is set on mental acts of goodwill with regard
to his fellows in the holy life, to their faces & behind their backs. This is a
condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack
of disputes, harmony, & a state of unity.

“Puna c’aparaª bhikkhave bhikkhu, ye te l›bh›

ekı-bh›v›ya saªvattati.

[4] “Furthermore, whatever righteous gains the monk may obtain in a
righteous way—even if only as much as the alms in his bowl—he does not
consume them alone. He consumes them after sharing them in common with
his virtuous fellows in the holy life. This is a condition that is conducive to
amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, & a state
of unity.

“Puna c’aparaª bhikkhave bhikkhu, y›ni t›ni sıl›ni

saªvattati.
[5] “Furthermore—with reference to the virtues that are untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished,
leading to concentration—the monk dwells with such virtues on a par with
that of his fellows in the holy life, to their faces & behind their backs. This is
a condition that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment, engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of
disputes, harmony, & a state of unity.

“Puna c’aparaª bhikkhave bhikkhu, y›yaª di˛˛hi

saªvattati.
[6] “Furthermore—with reference to a view that is noble, leading outward,
that leads those who act in accordance with it to the right ending of suffering
& stress—the monk dwells with such a view on a par with those of his

fellows in the holy life, to their faces & behind their backs. This is a condition
that is conducive to amiability, that engenders feelings of endearment,
engenders feelings of respect, leading to a sense of fellowship, a lack of
disputes, harmony, & a state of unity.

“Ime kho bhikkhave cha dhamm› s›r›˚ıy› piyakara˚› garu-kara˚›, saºgah›ya aviv›d›ya s›maggiy›
ekı-bh›v›ya saªvattantıti.”
“These are the six conditions that are conducive to amiability, that engender feelings of endearment, engender feelings of respect, leading to a sense of
fellowship, a lack of disputes, harmony, & a state of unity.”

Idam-avoca Bhagav›. Attaman› te bhikkhÒ
Bhagavato bh›sitaª, abhinandunti.
That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the
Blessed One’s words.

Gotamı Sutta
The Discourse to Gotamı

[Evam-me sutaª,] Ekaª samayaª Bhagav›,
Ves›liyaª viharati, Mah›-vane kÒ˛›g›ra-s›l›yaª,
I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying at Ves›lı, in the
Peaked Roof Hall in the Great Forest.

Atha kho Mah›paj›pati Gotamı, Yena Bhagav›
ten’upasaºkami, Upasaºkamitv› Bhagavantaª
abhiv›detv› ekam-antaª a˛˛h›si.
Then Mah›paj›pati Gotamı approached the Blessed One and, on
approaching, having bowed down to him, stood to one side.

Ekam-antaª ˛hit› kho Mah›paj›pati Gotamı
Bhagavantaª etad-avoca: “S›dhu me bhante
Bhagav› saºkhittena dhammaª desetu, Yam-ahaª
Bhagavato dhammaª sutv›, Ek› vÒpaka˛˛h›

appamatt› ›t›pinı pahitatt› vihareyyanti.”
As she was standing to one side, she said to the Blessed One: “It would be
good, Venerable Sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief
such that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell
alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, & resolute.”

“Ye kho tvaª Gotami dhamme j›neyy›si,
‘Ime dhamm› sar›g›ya saªvattanti no vir›g›ya.
“Gotami, the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities lead to
passion, not to dispassion;

Saªyog›ya saªvattanti no visaªyog›ya.
to being fettered, not to being unfettered;

ﬁcay›ya saªvattanti no apacay›ya.

to laziness, not to activated persistence;

Dubbharat›ya saªvattanti no subharat›y›ti’:
to being burdensome, not to being unburdensome’:

Ekaªsena Gotami dh›reyy›si, N’eso dhammo n’eso
vinayo n’etaª satthu-s›sananti.
You may categorically hold, ‘This is not the Dhamma, this is not the Vinaya,
this is not the Teacher’s instruction.’

Ye ca kho tvaª Gotami dhamme j›neyy›si,
‘Ime dhamm› vir›g›ya saªvattanti no sar›g›ya.
As for the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities lead to
dispassion, not to passion;

Visaªyog›ya saªvattanti no saªyog›ya.
to being unfettered, not to being fettered;

Apacay›ya saªvattanti no ›cay›ya.
to shedding, not to accumulation;

Appicchat›ya saªvattanti no mahicchat›ya.
to modesty, not to overweaning ambition;

Santu˛˛hiy› saªvattanti no asantu˛˛hiy›.
to contentment, not to discontent;

Pavivek›ya saªvattanti no saºga˚ik›ya.
to seclusion, not to entanglement;

Viriy›rambh›ya saªvattanti no kosajj›ya.
to activated persistence, not to laziness;

Subharat›ya saªvattanti no dubbharat›y›ti’:
to being unburdensome, not to being burdensome’:

Ekaªsena Gotami dh›reyy›si, Eso dhammo eso
vinayo etaª satthu-s›sananti.” You may categorically hold,
‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’”

Idam-avoca Bhagav›. Attaman› Mah›paj›pati
Gotamı Bhagavato bh›sitaª, abhinandıti.
That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Mah›paj›pati Gotamı
delighted at his words.

Evam-etassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa,
samudayo hoti.
Thus is the origination of this entire mass of suffering & stress.

Evam-etassa kevalassa dukkhakkhandhassa,
nirodho hoti.
Thus is the stopping of this entire mass of suffering & stress.

Heedfulness
Appam›do amataª padaª Pam›do maccuno padaª.
Heedfulness, the path to the Deathless.
Heedlessness, the path to death.

Appammatt› ne miyyanti Ye pamatt› yath› mat›.
The heedful do not die.
The heedless, as if already dead.

Etaª vesesato ñatv›

Appam›damhi pa˚˜it›ti.

As phenomena grow clear
to the Brahman, ardent, in jhana,
his doubts all vanish
when he discerns what has a cause.

ﬁt›pino jh›yato br›hma˚assa
Athassa kaºkh› vapayanti sabb›

to the Brahman, ardent, in jhana,
his doubts all vanish
when he penetrates the end of conditions.

Yad› have p›tubhavanti dhamm›
ﬁt›pino jh›yato br›hma˚assa
VidhÒpayaª ti˛˛hati M›ra-senaª
SÒrova obh›sayam-antalikkhanti.
As phenomena grow clear
to the Brahman, ardent, in jhana,
he stands,
routing M›ra’s army,
as the sun,
illumining the sky.

The House Builder
Aneka-j›ti-saºs›raª
Gahak›raª gavesanto

Sandh›vissaª anibbisaª
Dukkh› j›ti punappunaª.

Through the round of many births I roamed
without reward, without rest,
seeking the house builder.
Painful is birth again & again.

Gahak›raka di˛˛ho’si

Puna-gehaª na k›hasi.

House builder, you are seen!
You will not build a house again.

Sabb› te ph›suk› bhagg› GahakÒ˛aª visaºkhataª
Visaºkh›ra-gataª cittaª Ta˚h›naª khayam-ajjhag›.
All your rafters are broken,
the ridgepole dismantled,
immersed in dismantling, the mind
has attained the end of craving.

The Mountain
Yath›pi sel› vipul›
Nabhaª ›hacca pabbat›

Like massive boulders,
mountains pressing against the sky
moving in from all sides,
crushing the four directions,

Evaª jar› ca maccu ca
Adhivattanti p›˚ino
Khattiye br›hma˚e vesse Sudde ca˚˜›la-pukkuse.
In the same way, aging & death
roll over living beings:
noble warriors, br›hmans, merchants,
workers, outcastes, & scavengers.

Na kiñci parivajjeti
Sabbam-ev›bhimaddati.
Na tattha hatthınaª bhÒmi Na rath›naª na pattiy›
Na c›pi manta-yuddhena Sakk› jetuª dhanena v›.
They spare nothing.
They trample everything.
Here elephants can hold no ground,
nor can chariots or infantry,
nor can a battle of spells
or wealth win out.

Tasm› hi pa˚˜ito poso
Sampassaª attham-attano
Buddhe Dhamme ca Saºghe ca
Dhıro saddhaª nivesaye.
So a wise person,
seeing his own good,
enlightened, secures conviction
in the Buddha, Dhamma, & Saºgha.

Yo dhammac›rı k›yena
Idh’eva naª pasaªsanti

V›c›ya uda cetas›
Pecca sagge pamodati.

He who practices the Dhamma

One whose conviction in the Tath›gata

Amoghan-tassa jıvitaª.

who has faith in the Saºgha, straightforwardness, vision:
“Not poor,” they say of him. Not in vain his life.

Tasm› saddhañ-ca sılañ-ca
Pas›daª dhamma-dassanaª
Anuyuñjetha medh›vı Saraª buddh›na-s›sananti.
So conviction & virtue, faith, & dhamma-vision
should be cultivated by the wise,
remembering the Buddhas’ teachings.

An Auspicious Day
Atıtaª n›nv›gameyya
Yad’atıtam-pahınantaª

Nappa˛ikaºkhe an›gataª.
Appattañ-ca an›gataª.

You shouldn’t chase after the past,
or place expectations on the future.
What is past is left behind.
The future is as yet unreached.

Paccuppannañ-ca yo dhammaª
Tattha tattha vipassati.
Asaªhiraª asaºkuppaª Taª viddh› manubrÒhaye.
Whatever phenomenon is present,
you clearly see right there, right there.
Unvanquished, unshaken,
that’s how you develop the mind.

Ajjeva kiccam-›tappaª
Na hi no saºgarantena

Ko jaññ› mara˚aª suve.
Mah›senena maccun›.

Doing your duty ardently today,
for—who knows?—tomorrow: death.
There is no bargaining
with Death & his mighty horde.

Aho-rattam-atanditaª
Taª ve bhaddeka-ratto’ti Santo ›cikkhate munıti.

Whoever lives thus ardently,
relentlessly both day & night,
has truly had an auspicious day:
So says the Peaceful Sage.

The Three Characteristics
“Sabbe saºkh›r› anicc›’ti” Yad› paññ›ya passati,
Atha nibbindati dukkhe: Esa maggo visuddhiy›.
“All fabrications are inconstant.”
When you see this with discernment,
you grow disenchanted with stress:
This is the path to purity.

“Sabbe saºkh›r› dukkh›’ti” Yad› paññ›ya passati,
Atha nibbindati dukkhe: Esa maggo visuddhiy›.
“All fabrications are stressful.”
When you see this with discernment,
you grow disenchanted with stress:
This is the path to purity.

“Sabbe dhamm› anatt›’ti” Yad› paññ›ya passati,
Atha nibbindati dukkhe: Esa maggo visuddhiy›.
“All phenomena are not-self.”
When you see this with discernment,
you grow disenchanted with stress:
This is the path to purity.

Appak› te manussesu
Ath›yaª itar› paj›

Ye jan› p›ra-g›mino.
Tıram-ev›nudh›vati.

Few are the human beings who go to the Further Shore.
These others simply scurry around on this shore.

Ye ca kho sammadakkh›te
Dhamme dhamm›nuvattino,
Te jan› p›ramessanti Maccudheyyaª suduttaraª.

But those who practice the Dhamma
in line with the well-taught Dhamma,
will cross over Death’s realm, so hard to transcend.

Ka˚haª dhammaª vippah›ya
Sukkaª bh›vetha pa˚˜ito,
Ok› anokam-›gamma
Viveke yattha dÒramaª.
Abandoning dark practices,
the wise person should develop the bright,
having gone from home to no-home
in seclusion, so hard to relish.

Tatr›bhiratim-iccheyya
Pariyodapeyya att›naª

Hitv› k›me akiñcano.
Citta-klesehi pa˚˜ito.

There he should wish for delight,
having discarded sensuality—he who has nothing.
He should cleanse himself,
the wise one, of mental defilements.

Yesaª sambodhiyaºgesu Samm› cittaª subh›vitaª
ﬁd›na-pa˛inissagge
Anup›d›ya ye rat›,
Khı˚’›sav› jutimanto
Te loke parinibbut›’ti.
Whose minds are well developed in the factors for Awakening,
who, relinquishing grasping, delight in non-clinging,
glorious, free of effluent: They, in the world, are unbound.

Tath’ev›haª mariss›mi N’atthi me ettha saºsayo.
How inconstant are fabrications! Their nature: to arise & pass away.
They disband as they are arising. Their total stilling is bliss.
All living beings are dying, have died, and will die.
In the same way, I will die: I have no doubt about this.

There is no doubt that the Blessed One is worthy and
rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &

desiring their welfare, he first set the unexcelled Wheel of
Dhamma in motion on the full moon night of the month of

fis›˘ha, in the Deer Refuge at the Meeting Place of the

If something’s to be done, then work at it firmly,

It’s better to leave a misdeed undone. A misdeed burns you afterward.
Better that a good deed be done
that, when you’ve done it, you don’t regret.

Just as sharp-bladed grass, if wrongly held,
wounds the very hand that holds it—
the contemplative life, if wrongly grasped, drags you down to hell.
Any slack act, or defiled observance, or fraudulent holy life
bears no great fruit.

Note: These stanzas are chanted as part of every anumodana. If two or more monks
are chanting, they should repeat the two lines beginning “Sabbitiyo...” three times
before going on to the lines beginning ”Abhivadana-silissa....” On some occasions,
the leader will omit his solo part and will lead the entire group in chanting the following verses as a prelude to the passage beginning “Sabbityo....”

“He gave to me, he acted on my behalf,
and he was my relative, companion, friend”:
Offerings should be given for the dead
when one reflects (thus) on what was done in the past.
For no weeping or sorrowing or any kind of lamentation
benefit the dead whose relatives keep acting in that way.
* But when this offering is given, well-placed in the Saºgha,
it works for their long-term benefit
and they profit immediately.
In this way the proper duty to relatives has been shown
and great honor has been done to the dead
and the monks have been given strength:
You’ve acquired merit that’s not small.
Note: These verses are the concluding part of the Tirokuddakanda Sutta (Discourse
on Those Outside the Wall) , Khuddakapatha 8. They are often chanted on occasions when donors dedicate merit to the dead. A common practice is for the leader
to begin chanting at the asterisk, omitting the first four lines.

For whatever aim a wise householder

I have done what will not lead to future distress.”
When this is recollected by a mortal,
a person established in the Dhamma of the Noble Ones,
He is praised in this life and, after death, rejoices in heaven.
Note: These verses are from the Adiya Sutta (Discourse on Benefits to be Obtained),
Anguttara Nikaya 5:41. The “five oblations” are gifts/offerings given to one’s relatives, guests, the dead, kings (taxes paid to the government), and devas. This passage is often chanted when donors are dedicating a donation to a relative or friend
long deceased.

Now, if these bonds of fellowship were lacking,
a mother would not receive

But because the wise
show regard for these bonds of fellowship,
they achieve greatness and are praised.

Therefore, with an unhesitant mind,
one should give where the gift bears great fruit.
Merit is what establishes living beings in the next life.
Note: These verses are from the Kala-dana Sutta (Discourse on Seasonable Gifts),
Anguttara Nikaya 5:36. They are often chanted when large groups of people organize a donation for a special occasion, such as a kathina.

Being respected, will show him respect.
As a result, they will feel sympathy for him,
like that of a mother for her child.
A person with whom the devas sympathize
always sees things go auspiciously.
Note: These verses are from the Maha-Parinibbana Suttanta (Great Discourse on
the Total Unbinding), Digha Nikaya 16. They are frequently chanted when the
donor is making merit on the occasion of his/her birthday or a house-warming.

Breath Meditation: Seven Steps
There are seven basic steps:
1. Start out with three or seven long in-&-out breaths, thinking budwith the in-breath, and dho with the out. Keep the meditation syllable
as long as the breath.
2. Be clearly aware of each in-&-out breath.
3. Observe the breath as it goes in & out, noticing whether it’s comfortable or uncomfortable, broad or narrow, obstructed or free-flowing,
fast or slow, short or long, warm or cool. If the breath doesn’t feel comfortable, change it until it does. For instance, if breathing in long & out
long is uncomfortable, try breathing in short & out short. As soon as
you find that your breathing feels comfortable, let this comfortable
breath sensation spread to the different parts of the body.
To begin with, inhale the breath sensation at the base of the skull
and let it flow all the way down the spine. Then, if you are male, let
it spread down your right leg to the sole of your foot, to the ends of
your toes, and out into the air. Inhale the breath sensation at the base
of the skull again and let it spread down your spine, down your left
leg to the ends of your toes, and out into the air. (If you are female,
begin with the left side first, because the male & female nervous
systems are different.)
Then let the breath from the base of the skull spread down over both
shoulders, past your elbows & wrists, to the tips of your fingers, and
out into the air.
Let the breath at the base of the throat spread down the central
nerve at the front of the body, past the lungs & liver, all the way down
to the bladder & colon.
Inhale the breath right at the middle of the chest and let it go all the
way down to your intestines.
Let all these breath sensations spread so that they connect & flow
together, and you’ll feel a greatly improved sense of well-being.
4. Learn four ways of adjusting the breath:
a. in long & out long,
b. in long & out short,
c. in short & out long,
d. in short & out short.

Breathe whichever way is most comfortable for you. Or, better yet,
learn to breathe comfortably all four ways, because your physical condition & your breath are always changing.
5. Become acquainted with the bases or focal points for the mind—
the resting spots of the breath—and center your awareness on
whichever one seems most comfortable. A few of these bases are:
a. the tip of the nose,
b. the middle of the head,
c. the palate,
d. the base of the throat,
e. the breastbone (the tip of the sternum),
f. the navel (or a point just above it).
If you suffer from frequent headaches or nervous problems, don’t
focus on any spot above the base of the throat. And don’t try to force the
breath or put yourself into a trance. Breathe freely & naturally. Let the
mind be at ease with the breath—but not to the point where it slips
away.
6. Spread your awareness—your sense of conscious feeling—
throughout the entire body.
7. Unite the breath sensations throughout the body, letting them flow
together comfortably, keeping your awareness as broad as possible.
Once you are fully aware of the aspects of the breath you already know
in your body, you’ll come to know all sorts of other aspects as well. The
breath, by its nature, has many facets: breath sensations flowing in the
nerves, those flowing around & about the nerves, those spreading from
the nerves to every pore. Beneficial breath sensations & harmful ones
are mixed together by their very nature.
To summarize: (a) for the sake of improving the energy already existing in every part of your body, so that you can contend with such
things as disease & pain; and (b) for the sake of clarifying the knowledge already within you, so that it can become a basis for the skills leading to release & purity of heart—you should always bear these seven
steps in mind, because they are absolutely basic to every aspect of
breath meditation.
—Phra Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo

The Lord Buddha taught that his Dhamma, when placed in
the heart of an ordinary run-of-the-mill person, is bound to be
thoroughly corrupted, but if placed in the heart of a Noble One,
it is bound to be genuinely pure & authentic, something that at
the same time can be neither effaced nor obscured.
So as long as we are devoting ourselves merely to the theoretical study of the Dhamma, it can’t serve us well. Only when we
have trained our hearts to eliminate their ‘chameleons’—their defilements—will it benefit us in full measure. And only then will
the true Dhamma be kept pure, free from distortions & deviations
from its original principles.
—Phra Ajaan Mun BhÒridatto

The practice of the Dhamma in keeping with the Dhamma that
he gave with utter compassion unequalled by that of anyone else
in the world: This is the true homage to the Buddha. The seeing of
the truth that lies within you, using discernment step by step at
all times: This is the seeing of the Buddha step by step. The seeing
of the truth with the full heart using discernment: This is the seeing of the Buddha in full. The true Buddha, the true Dhamma, lie
with the heart. To attend to your own heart is to attend to the Buddha. To watch over your own heart with mindfulness & discernment is to see the Buddha, Dhamma, & Saºgha in a genuine way.
—Phra Ajaan Maha Boowa Ñ›˚asampanno

The Council Chant
This chant, which apparently was composed as an abbreviated reenactment of
the First Council, is frequently recited at ceremonies connected with making merit
for the dead. The first part begins with an expanded version of the conversation
between Ven. Mah›Kassapa and Ven. Up›li at the First Council, briefly reported
in Cullavagga XI, in which Ven. Mah›Kassapa questions Ven. Up›li about the origins of the P›˛imokkha rules. After treating the origins of the first p›r›jika rule, the
chant then quotes the first passage of the entire Vinaya Pi˛aka. The second part
quotes the first passage in the Suttanta Pi˛aka, the beginning of the Brahmaj›la
Sutta (DN 1). The last part quotes the first passage from each of the seven books
of the Abhidhamma Pi˛aka, giving an elided version of the beginning of the Dh›tukath› (Discourse on Properties).
In the following transcription, the underlined syllables are those that are
highlighted in the two main styles of chanting in Thailand. In the Magadha style,
these syllables are pronounced with a falling tone; in the Saªyoga style, they
are pronounced with a rising tone.

Vinaya
[“Yantena Bhagavat›] j›nat› passat› arahat› Samm›sambuddhena, pa˛hamaª p›r›jikaª kattha

“Where was the first p›r›jika rule formulated by the Blessed One—the One
who knows, the One who sees, the Worthy One, Rightly Self-awakened?”

“Ves›liyaª paññattanti.”
“It was formulated in Ves›lı.”

“Kaª ›rabbh›ti?”
“Whom did it concern?”

“Sudinnaª Kalantaputtaª ›rabbh›ti.”
“It concerned Sudinna the Kalanta-son.”

“Kismiª vatthusmiª?”

“With regard to what incident?”

“Sudinno Kalantaputto pur›˚a-dutiyik›ya methunaª

A br›hman of Verañja heard, ‘They say that Gotama the contemplative—a
son of the Sakyans who has gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying at
Verañja at the foot of Ne˘eru’s nimba tree with a large community of monks,
approximately 500 monks.

Now this fine report of the honorable Gotama’s reputation has spread far &
wide: “He is a Blessed One, a Worthy One, a Rightly Self-awakened One,
consummate in knowledge & conduct, one who has gone the good way,
knower of the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of those who can be taught, teacher

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was traveling on the highway between R›jagaha and N›landa with a large community of monks, approximately 500 monks.

Suppiyo-pi kho paribb›jako, antar› ca R›jagahaª

And Suppiya the wanderer was traveling on the highway between R›jagaha
and N›landa with his apprentice, Brahmadatta the young br›hman.

Along the way, Suppiya the wanderer spoke in many ways in dispraise of the
Buddha, in dispraise of the Dhamma, in dispraise of the Saºgha. But Suppiya the wanderer’s apprentice, Brahmadatta the young br›hman, spoke in
many ways in praise of the Buddha, in praise of the Dhamma, in praise of
the Saºgha.

Thus both of these, mentor & apprentice, speaking in direct contradiction to
each other, followed right behind the Blessed One and the community of
monks.

He, with a clear, bright awareness,

They teach him the Dhamma,

will without effluent
