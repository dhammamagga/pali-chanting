Remembering the Blessed One, the Noble Lord, and
Perfectly Enlightened One, who long ago attained Parinibbāna,
Saddhā agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajitā
We have gone forth with faith from home to homelessness,
Tasmiṃ bhagavati brahma-cariyaṃ carāma

And like the Blessed One, we practise the Holy Life,

Verses of sharing and aspiration
[Now let us chant the verses of sharing and aspiration.]
Through the goodness that arises from my practice,
May my spiritual teachers and guides of great virtue,
My mother, my father, and my relatives,
The Sun and the Moon, and all virtuous leaders of the world,
May the highest gods and evil forces,
Celestial beings, guardian spirits of the Earth, and the Lord of Death,
May those who are friendly, indifferent, or hostile,
May all beings receive the blessings of my life.
May they soon attain the threefold bliss and realise the Deathless.
Through the goodness that arises from my practice,
And through this act of sharing,
May all desires and attachments quickly cease
And all harmful states of mind.
Until I realise Nibbāna,
In every kind of birth, may I have an upright mind,
With mindfulness and wisdom, austerity and vigour.
May the forces of delusion not take hold nor weaken my resolve.
The Buddha is my excellent refuge,
Unsurpassed is the protection of the Dhamma,
The Solitary Buddha is my noble guide,
The Sangha is my supreme support.
Through the supreme power of all these,
May darkness and delusion be dispelled.

Verses on the sharing of merit
[Handa mayaṃ sabba-patti-dāna-gāthāyo bhaṇāmase]
Puññass’idāni katassa yān’aññāni katāni me
Tesañ-ca bhāgino hontu sattānantāppamāṇakā
May whatever living beings,
Without measure without end
Partake of all the merit
From the good deedsI have done:
Ye piyā guṇavantā ca mayhaṃ mātā-pitā-dayo
Diṭṭhā me cāpy-adiṭṭhā vā aññe majjhatta-verino
Those loved and full of goodness,
My mother and my father dear,
Beings seen by me and those unseen,
Those neutral and averse,
Sattā tiṭṭhanti lokasmiṃ te-bhummā catu-yonikā
Pañc’eka-catu-vokārā saṃsarantā bhavābhave
Beings established in the world
From the three planes and four grounds of birth,
With five aggregates or one or four,
Wand’ring on from realm to realm,
Ñātaṃ ye patti-dānam-me anumodantu te sayaṃ
Ye c’imaṃ nappajānanti devā tesaṃ nivedayuṃ

Those who know my act of dedication,
May they all rejoice in it
And as for those yet unaware,
May the devas let them know.
Mayā dinnāna-puññānaṃ anumodana-hetunā
Sabbe sattā sadā hontu averā sukha-jīvino
Khemappadañ-ca pappontu tesāsā sijjhataṃ subhā
By rejoicing in my sharing
May all beings live at ease,
In freedom from hostility,

And may they all reach safety.

Reﬂection on universal well-being
[Handa mayam mettāpharaṇaṃ karomase]
[Ahaṃ sukhito homi,]
niddukkho homi,
avero homi,
abyāpajjho homi,
anīgho homi,
sukhī attānaṃ pariharāmi.
Sabbe sattā sukhitā hontu,
sabbe sattā averā hontu,
sabbe sattā abyāpajjhā hontu,
sabbe sattā anīghā hontu,
sabbe sattā sukhī
attānaṃ pariharantu.
Sabbe sattā sabbadukkhā pamuccantu.
Sabbe sattā laddha-sampattito mā vigacchantu.
Sabbe sattā kammassakā kammadāyādā kammayonī
kammabandhū kammapaṭisaraṇā,
yaṃ kammaṃ karissanti,
kalyāṇaṃ vā pāpakaṃ vā,
tassa dāyādā bhavissanti.

Reﬂection on universal well-being
[Now let us chant the reflections on universal well-being.]
[May I abide in well-being,]
in freedom from affliction,
in freedom from hostility,
in freedom from ill-will,
in freedom from anxiety,
and may I maintain well-being in myself.
May everyone abide in well-being,
in freedom from hostility,
in freedom from ill-will,
in freedom from anxiety, and may they
maintain well-being in themselves.
May all beings be released from all suffering.
And may they not be parted from the
good fortune they have attained.
When they act upon intention,
all beings are the owners of their action and inherit its results.
Their future is born from such action, companion to such action,
and its results will be their home.
All actions with intention,
be they skilful or harmful –
of such acts they will be the heirs.

The Buddha’s words on loving-kindness
[Now let us chant the Buddha’s words on loving-kindness.]
[Karaṇīyam-attha-kusalena,]
Yan-taṃ santaṃ padaṃ abhisamecca;
Sakko ujū ca suhujū ca,
Suvaco c’assa mudu anatimānī,
Santussako ca subharo ca,
Appakicco ca sallahuka-vutti;
Sant’indriyo ca nipako ca,
Appagabbho kulesu ananugiddho.
Na ca khuddaṃ samācare kiñci,
Yena viññū pare upavadeyyuṃ;
Sukhino vā khemino hontu,
Sabbe sattā bhavantu sukhit’attā:
Ye keci pāṇa-bhūt’atthi,
Tasā vā thāvarā vā anavasesā;
Dīghā vā ye mahantā vā,
Majjhimā rassakā aṇuka-thūlā.
Diṭṭhā vā ye ca adiṭṭhā,
Ye ca dūre vasanti avidūre;
Bhūtā vā sambhavesī vā,
Sabbe sattā bhavantu sukhit’attā.

The Buddha’s words on loving-kindness
[Now let us chant the Buddha’s words on loving-kindness.]
[This is what should be done]
By one who is skilled in goodness
And who knows the path of peace:
Let them be able and upright,
Straightforward and gentle in speech,
Humble and not conceited,
Contented and easily satisfied,
Unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways.
Peaceful and calm, and wise and skilful,
Not proud and demanding in nature.
Let them not do the slightest thing
That the wise would later reprove,
Wishing: In gladness and in safety,
May all beings be at ease.
Whatever living beings there may be,
Whether they are weak or strong, omitting none,
The great or the mighty, medium, short, or small,
The seen and the unseen,
Those living near and far away,
Those born and to be born,
May all beings be at ease.

Na paro paraṃ nikubbetha,
Nātimaññetha katthaci naṃ kiñci;
Byārosanā paṭighasaññā,
Nāññam-aññassa dukkham-iccheyya.
Mātā yathā niyaṃ puttaṃ,
āyusā eka-puttam-anurakkhe;
Evam pi sabba-bhūtesu,
Mānasam-bhāvaye aparimāṇaṃ.
Mettañ-ca sabba-lokasmiṃ,
Mānasam-bhāvaye aparimāṇaṃ;
Uddhaṃ adho ca tiriyañ-ca,
Asambādhaṃ averaṃ asapattaṃ.
Tiṭṭhañ-caraṃ nisinno vā,
Sayāno vā yāvat’assa vigata-middho;
Etaṃ satiṃ adhiṭṭheyya,
Brahmam-etaṃ vihāraṃ idham-āhu.

Let none deceive another
Or despise any being in any state.
Let none through anger or ill-will
Wish harm upon another.
Even as a mother protects with her life
Her child, her only child,
So with a boundless heart
Should one cherish all living beings,
Radiating kindness over the entire world:
Spreading upwards to the skies
And downwards to the depths,
Outwards and unbounded,
Freed from hatred and ill-will.
Whether standing or walking, seated,
Or lying down – free from drowsiness –
One should sustain this recollection.
This is said to be the sublime abiding.
By not holding to fixed views,
The pure-hearted one, having clarity of vision,
Being freed from all sense-desires,
Is not born again into this world.

The highest blessings
[Now let us chant the verses on the Highest Blessings]
[Thus have I heard that the Blessed One]
Was staying at Sāvatthī,
Residing at the Jeta’s Grove
In Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.
Then in the dark of the night, a radiant deva
Illuminated all Jeta’s Grove.
She bowed down low before the Blessed One
Then standing to one side she said:
Devas are concerned for happiness
And ever long for peace.
The same is true for humankind.
What then are the highest blessings?’
Avoiding those of foolish ways,
Associating with the wise,
And honouring those worthy of honour.
These are the highest blessings.
Living in places of suitable kinds,
With the fruits of past good deeds
And guided by the rightful way.
These are the highest blessings.

Bāhu-saccañ-ca sippañ-ca,
Vinayo ca susikkhito;
Subhāsitā ca yā vācā,

Accomplished in learning and craftsman’s skills,
With discipline, highly trained,
And speech that is true and pleasant to hear.
These are the highest blessings.
Providing for mother and father’s support
And cherishing family,
And ways of work that harm no being,
These are the highest blessings.
Generosity and a righteous life,
Offering help to relatives and kin,
And acting in ways that leave no blame.
These are the highest blessings.
Steadfast in restraint, and shunning evil ways,
Avoiding intoxicants that dull the mind,
And heedfulness in all things that arise.
These are the highest blessings.
Respectfulness and being of humble ways,
Contentment and gratitude,
And hearing the Dhamma frequently taught.
These are the highest blessings.
Patience and willingness to accept one’s faults,
Seeing venerated seekers of the truth,
And sharing often the words of Dhamma.
These are the highest blessings.

Tapo ca brahma-cariyañ-ca,

Tan-tesaṃ maṅgalam-uttaman-ti.

Ardent, committed to the Holy Life,
Seeing for oneself the Noble Truths
And the realization of Nibbāna.
These are the highest blessings.
Although in contact with the world,
Unshaken the mind remains
Beyond all sorrow, spotless, secure.
These are the highest blessings.
They who live by following this path
Know victory wherever they go,
And every place for them is safe.
These are the highest blessings.’

Reﬂection on the unconditioned
[Handa mayaṃ nibbāna-sutta-pāṭhaṃ bhaṇāmase]
Atthi bhikkhave ajātaṃ abhūtaṃ akataṃ asaṅkhataṃ
There is an Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated and Unformed.
No cetaṃ bhikkhave abhavissa
Ajātaṃ abhūtaṃ akataṃ asankhataṃ
If there was not this Unborn, this Unoriginated, this Uncreated, this
Unformed,
Na yidaṃ jātassa bhūtassa katassa saṅkhatassa nissaraṇaṃ paññāyetha
Freedom from the world of the born, the originated, the created, the
formed would not be possible.
Yasmā ca kho bhikkhave atthi ajātaṃ abhūtaṃ akataṃ asaṅkhataṃ
But since there is an Unborn, Unoriginated, Uncreated and Unformed,
Tasmā jātassa bhūtassa katassa saṅkhatassa nissaraṇaṃ paññāyati
Therefore is freedom possible from the world of the born, the originated,
the created and the formed.

Just as rivers
Yathā vāri-vahā pūrā

Just as rivers full of water

paripūrenti sāgaraṃ

Entirely fill up the sea

Evam-eva ito dinnaṃ

So will what’s here been given

petānaṃ upakappati

Bring blessings to departed spirits.

Icchitaṃ patthitaṃ tumhaṃ

May all your hopes and all your longings

Come true in no long time.

May all your wishes be fulfilled

Cando paṇṇa-raso yathā

Like on the fifteenth day the moon

Maṇi joti-raso yathā

or like a bright and shining gem.

Sabb’ītiyo vivajjantu

May all misfortunes be avoided,

Sabba-rogo vinassatu

May all illness be dispelled,

Mā te bhavatv-antarāyo

May you never meet with dangers,

Sukhī dīgh’āyuko bhava

May you be happy and live long.

Who always honour the elders,

Four are the qualities which will increase:

and strength.

Reﬂection on the four requisites
[Handa mayaṃ taṅkhaṇika-paccavekkhaṇa-pāṭhaṃ
bhaṇāmase]
[Paṭisaṅkhā] yoniso cīvaraṃ paṭisevāmi, yāvadeva sītassa
paṭighātāya, uṇhassa paṭighātāya, ḍaṃsa-makasa-vātātapa-siriṃsapa-samphassānaṃ paṭighātāya, yāvadeva hirikopina-paṭicchādanatthaṃ.
Wisely reflecting, I use the robe: only to ward off cold, to ward off heat, to
ward off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, burning and creeping things,
only for the sake of modesty.
[Paṭisaṅkhā] yoniso piṇḍapātaṃ paṭisevāmi, neva davāya, na madāya,
na maṇḍanāya, na vibhūsanāya, yāvadeva imassa kāyassa ṭhitiyā,
yāpanāya, vihiṃsūparatiyā, brahmacariyānuggahāya, iti purāṇañca
vedanaṃ paṭihaṅkhāmi, navañca vedanaṃ na uppādessāmi, yātrā ca
me bhavissati anavajjatā ca phāsuvihāro cā’ti.
Wisely reflecting, I use almsfood: not for fun, not for pleasure, not for
fattening, not for beautification, only for the maintenance and
nourishment of this body, for keeping it healthy, for helping with the Holy
Life; thinking thus, ‘I will allay hunger without overeating, so that I may
continue to live blamelessly and at ease.’
[Paṭisaṅkhā] yoniso senāsanaṃ paṭisevāmi, yāvadeva sītassa
paṭighātāya, uṇhassa paṭighātāya, ḍaṃsa-makasa-vātātapa-siriṃsapa-samphassānaṃ paṭighātāya, yāvadeva utuparissaya vinodanaṃ
paṭisallānārāmatthaṃ.

Wisely reflecting, I use the lodging: only to ward off cold, to ward off heat,
to ward off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, burning and creeping
things, only to remove the danger from weather, and for living in
seclusion.
[Paṭisaṅkhā] yoniso gilāna-paccaya-bhesajja-parikkhāraṃ paṭisevāmi,
yāvadeva uppannānaṃ veyyābādhikānaṃ vedanānaṃ paṭighātāya,
abyāpajjha-paramatāyā ti.
Wisely reflecting, I use supports for the sick and medicinal requisites: only
to ward off painful feelings that have arisen, for the maximum freedom
from disease.

Five subjects for frequent recollection

I am the owner of my kamma, heir to my kamma, born of my kamma,
related to my kamma, abide supported by my kamma.
Whatever kamma I shall do, for good or for ill, of that I will be the heir.
Evaṃ amhehi abhiṇhaṃ paccavekkhitabbaṃ
Thus we should frequently recollect.

Ten subjects for frequent recollection by one

kammapaṭisaraṇo, yaṃ kammaṃ karissāmi, kalyāṇaṃ vā pāpakaṃ vā,

‘I am the owner of my kamma, heir to my kamma, born of my kamma,
related to my kamma, abide supported by my kamma;
whatever kamma I shall do, for good or for ill, of that I will be the heir.’
This should be reflected upon again and again
by one who has gone forth.

‘Kathambhūtassa me rattindivā vītipatantī’ ti pabbajitena abhiṇhaṃ
paccavekkhitabbaṃ.
‘The days and nights are relentlessly passing;
how well am I spending my time?’

paccavekkhitabbaṃ.
‘Do I delight in solitude or not?’
This should be reflected upon again and again
by one who has gone forth.
‘Atthi nu kho me uttari-manussa-dhammā
alamariya-ñāṇa-dassana-viseso adhigato, so’haṃ pacchime kāle
sabrahmacārīhi puṭṭho na maṅku bhavissāmī’ ti pabbajitena abhiṇhaṃ
paccavekkhitabbaṃ.
‘Has my practice borne fruit with freedom or insight
so that at the end of my life I need not feel ashamed
when questioned by my spiritual companions?’
This should be reflected upon again and again
by one who has gone forth.
Ime kho bhikkhave dasa dhammā pabbajitena abhiṇhaṃ
paccavekkhitabbā ti.
Bhikkhus, these are the ten dhammas to be reflected upon again and
again by one who has gone forth.

Within the realm of sensuality,

Yāva-kīvañ-ca me bhikkhave imesu catūsu ariya-saccesu
Evan-ti-parivaṭṭaṃ dvādas’ākāraṃ yathā-bhūtaṃ ñāṇa-dassanaṃ na
suvisuddhaṃ ahosi
As long, bhikkhus, as my knowledge and understanding,
As it actually is,
Of these Four Noble Truths,
With their three phases and twelve aspects,
Was not entirely pure,
N’eva tāvāhaṃ bhikkhave sadevake loke samārake sabrahmake
Sassamaṇa-brāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadeva-manussāya
Anuttaraṃ sammā-sambodhiṃ abhisambuddho paccaññāsiṃ

The Teaching on striving according to
Dhamma
[Handa mayaṃ dhamma-pahaṃsāna-pāṭham bhaṇāmase]
Evaṃ svākkhāto bhikkhave mayā dhammo
Bhikkhus, the Dhamma has thus been well expounded by me,
Uttāno

Elucidated,

Vivaṭo

Disclosed,

Pakāsito

Revealed

Chinna-pilotiko

And stripped of patchwork –

Alam-eva saddhā-pabbajitena kula-puttena vīriyaṃ ārabhituṃ
This is enough for a clansman,
Who has gone forth out of faith,
To arouse his energy thus:
Kāmaṃ taco ca nahāru ca aṭṭhi ca avasissatu
‘Willingly let only my skin, sinews and bones remain,
Sarīre upasussatu maṃsa-lohitaṃ
And let the flesh and blood in this body wither away.
Yaṃ taṃ

As long as whatever is to be attained

Purisa-thāmena

By human strength,

Purisa-vīriyena

By human energy,

Purisa-parakkamena

By human effort

Pattabbaṃ na taṃ apāpuṇitvā

Has not been attained,

Vīriyassa saṇṭhānaṃ bhavissatī-ti

Let not my efforts stand still.’

Dukkhaṃ bhikkhave kusīto viharati
Bhikkhus, the lazy person dwells in suffering,
Vokiṇṇo pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi
Soiled by evil, unwholesome states
Mahantañ-ca sadatthaṃ parihāpeti
And great is the personal good that he neglects.
Āraddha-vīriyo ca kho bhikkhave sukhaṃ viharati
The energetic person though dwells happily,
Pavivitto pāpakehi akusalehi dhammehi
Well withdrawn from unwholesome states
Mahantañ-ca sadatthaṃ paripūreti
And great is the personal good that he achieves.
Na bhikkhave hīnena aggassa patti hoti
Bhikkhus, it is not by lower means that the supreme is attained
Aggena ca kho bhikkhave aggassa patti hoti

But, bhikkhus, it is by the supreme that the supreme is attained.
Maṇḍapeyyam-idaṃ bhikkhave brahmacariyaṃ
Bhikkhus, this holy life is like the cream of the milk:
Satthā sammukhī-bhūto
The Teacher is present,
Tasmātiha bhikkhave vīriyaṃ ārabhatha
Therefore, bhikkhus, start to arouse your energy
Appattassa pattiyā

For the attainment of the as yet unattained,

Anadhigatassa adhigamāya

For the achievement of the as yet unachieved,

Asacchikatassa sacchikiriyāya

For the realization of the as yet unrealized.

‘Evaṃ no ayaṃ amhākaṃ pabbajjā avaṅkatā avañjhā bhavissati
Thinking, in such a way: ‘Our Going Forth will not be barren
Saphalā sa-udrayā.
But will become fruitful and fertile,
Yesaṃ mayaṃ paribhuñjāma cīvara-piṇḍapātaSenāsana-gilānappaccaya-bhesajja-parikkhāraṃ
Tesaṃ te kārā amhesu
And all our use of robes, almsfood,
lodgings, and medicinal requisites,
Given by others for our support,

Mahapphalā bhavissanti mahā-nisaṃsā-ti
Will reward them with great fruit and great benefit.’
Evaṃ hi vo bhikkhave sikkhitabbaṃ
Bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus:
Att’atthaṃ vā hi bhikkhave sampassamānena
Considering your own good,
Alam-eva appamādena sampādetuṃ
It is enough to strive for the goal without negligence;
Par’atthaṃ vā hi bhikkhave sampassamānena
Bhikkhus, considering the good of others,
Alam-eva appamādena sampādetuṃ
It is enoughto strive for the goal without negligence;
Ubhay’atthaṃ vā hi bhikkhave sampassamānena
Bhikkhus, considering the good of both,
Alam-eva appamādena sampādetun-ti
It is enough to strive for the goal without negligence.

The Verses of Tāyana
[Handa mayaṃ tāyana-gāthāyo bhaṇāmase]
Chinda sotaṃ parakkamma

Kāme panūda brāhmaṇa

Nappahāya muni kāme

Nekattam-upapajjati

Exert yourself and cut the stream.
Discard sense-pleasures, Holy Man;
Not letting sensual pleasures go,
A sage will not reach unity.
Kayirā ce kayirāthenaṃ

Daḷham-enaṃ parakkame

Sithilo hi paribbājo

Bhiyyo ākirate rajaṃ

Vigorously, with all one’s strength,
It should be done, what should be done;
A lax monastic life stirs up
The dust of passions all the more
Akataṃ dukkaṭaṃ seyyo

Pacchā tappati dukkaṭaṃ

Katañ-ca sukataṃ seyyo

Yaṃ katvā nānutappati

Better is not to do bad deeds
That afterwards would bring remorse;
It’s rather good deeds one should do
Which having done one won’t regret.

Kuso yathā duggahito

Hattham-evānukantati

Sāmaññaṃ dupparāmaṭṭhaṃ

Nirayāyūpakaḍḍhati

As Kusa-grass, when wrongly grasped,
Will only cut into one’s hand
So does the monk’s life wrongly led
Indeed drag one to hellish states.
Yaṃ-kiñci sithilaṃ kammaṃ

Saṅkiliṭṭhañ-ca yaṃ vataṃ

Saṅkassaraṃ brahma-cariyaṃ

Na taṃ hoti mahapphalan-ti

Whatever deed that’s slackly done,
Whatever vow corruptly kept,
The Holy Life led in doubtful ways –
All these will never bear great fruits.
